# emotionRecognition

It contains the model which I've trained for Emotion Recognition (I've used FER2013 dataset). It is in both the forrmats i.e. hd5 and pickle format.

EmotionRecog.ipynb is a Google Colaboratory file which I used for running this project. For testing purposes, please mount google drive and also upload three things on drive
- The model
- XML code
- Testing Image

haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml is the xml file used in croping the human face i.e. face detection in the image.
The idea of face croping was used by me as it provides greater accuracy in Emotion Recognition
